			<h1>Converting CMake to Premake for GLSLang</h1>
			<p>
				CMake is used by many, loved by fewer. <a href="https://premake.github.io/" >Premake</a>
				does not have as many
				users nor features. However, probably 99% of the features most people
				use in CMake are also available in Premake. So why not just use Premake
				instead?
				Well, most of the projects are already using CMake, so when it comes
				to implementing it in your own there is already a big hurdle.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's make that that hurdle a bit smaller by converting the
				<a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang">GLSLang</a>
				library's CMake to a custom premake which does the same basic
				making.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="text-highlight">Note:</span>
				The premake that will be constructed does not allow the same
				dynamic customizability as CMake does, it is instead written to
				only suit one need. However, I believe that the common approach
				for most make files is a "make and forget" approach, so it is in most
				cases probably fine ;).
			</p>

			<h2>Step 1: Figuring out project structure</h2>
			<p>
				This is the step that probably took the longest for me. I
				<em>strongly</em> recommend to use CMake to generate
				the file structure at first, so we know what is needed for our
				premake implementation and where to place is. After I did this
				it became a lot clearer on where to begin.
			</p>

			<p>
				After generating a basic solution with CMake (settings shouldn't
				really matter here) the basic structure of projects look like this:
				<div class="code-block">
					_OUTPUT_FOLDER_ <br>
					<span class="tab1">glslang.sln</span> <br>

					<span class="tab1">glslang/</span> <br>
					<span class="tab2">glslang.vcxproj</span> <br>
					<span class="tab2">OSDependent/</span> <br>
					<span class="tab3">Windows/</span> <br>
					<span class="tab4">OSDependent.vcxproj</span> <br>

					<span class="tab1">HLSL/</span> <br>
					<span class="tab2">HLSL.vcxproj</span> <br>

					<span class="tab1">OGLCompilersDLL/</span> <br>
					<span class="tab2">OGLCompiler.vcxproj</span> <br>

					<span class="tab1">SPIRV/</span> <br>
					<span class="tab2">SPIRV.vcxproj</span> <br>
				</div>
				I will not be using the HLSL part for this example but when we're
				finished it should be quite easy to implement by yourself.
			</p>

			<p>
				GLSLang likes to divide their structure in a lot of projects which
				means more work for us. However, when you have done one project, the
				rest will follow quite easy.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="text-highlight">Node:</span> I am building GLSLang
				as an independent library, which means we will not be generating the .sln file.
			</p>

			<h2>Step 2: Dependencies and build order</h2>
			<p>
				It's time to dive in to the CMake file. The file is long, but
				the most interesting part is at the bottom:
				<div class="code-block">
					add_subdirectory(glslang) <br>
					add_subdirectory(OGLCompilersDLL) <br>
					if(ENABLE_GLSLANG_BINARIES) <br>
					<span class="tab1">add_subdirectory(StandAlone)</span> <br>
					endif() <br>
					add_subdirectory(SPIRV) <br>
					if(ENABLE_HLSL) <br>
					<span class="tab1">add_subdirectory(hlsl)</span> <br>
					endif(ENABLE_HLSL) <br>
					if(ENABLE_CTEST) <br>
					<span class="tab1">add_subdirectory(gtests)</span> <br>
					endif() <br>
				</div>
			</p>

			NOT FINISHED. <br>
			TO EXPLAIN IN THIS STEP: <br>
			subdirectory runs a CMake file in another folder <br>
			this will probably make the .vcxproj files (check CMakes)
